## 1. The first thing you must do is to download a plain text editor so that you can write code.

-There are many different types of text editors out there but I prefer to use the free program Brackets since when you write a tag it automatically adds the end tag.

-Follow this link to download [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

## 2. Next open Brackets and create an HTML file.
-Open a new file and then click save as. When prompted enter the file name of your choice followed by the ".html" extension.

![name](name.png)

## 3. Now it is time to set up the HTML document, every HTML document must have 5 required tags:

![tags](tags.PNG)

-inside the head tag add the language identifier for english. Then add the style tag within the head element, this will be used to add CSS style later.
-
<head lang="en">
<style></style>
<head>
